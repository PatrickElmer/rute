# Rute.js

Rute.js is a lightweight, reactive single-page application router that combines hash-based routing with reactive data binding and localStorage persistence.

# Features

1. Automatic persistence: All bound data persists to localStorage per route
2. Two-way binding: Changes to inputs automatically update all bound elements
3. Computed properties: Real-time calculations that update when dependencies change
4. Hash-based routing: Simple navigation without page reloads
5. Scoped data: Each route maintains its own data state
